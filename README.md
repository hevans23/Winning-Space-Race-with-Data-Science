# Winning Space Race with Data Science
IBM Data Science Professional Certificate: Applied Data Science Capstone

This capstone project brings together the knowledge and skills learned throughout the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, applying them to an exciting project based around SpaceX rocket launches.

SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010.

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars wheras other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
